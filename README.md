Introduction to Internet of things(Iot) , Artificial intelligence(AI)and machine learning(ML) . And introduction about Arduino board. 
Iot devices collect real- time data from the environment. 
ML algorithms analyze patterns, trends and making predictions. 
AI systems automate actions and decision making based on predictions. 
They all are used in smart cities, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, etc.
