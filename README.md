Introduction to Internet of things(Iot) , Artificial intelligence(AI)and machine learning(ML) . And introduction about Arduino board. 
Iot devices collect real- time data from the environment. 
ML algorithms analyze patterns, trends and making predictions. 
AI systems automate actions and decision making based on predictions. 
They all are used in smart cities, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, etc.

Iot Architecture, Oracle's iot architecture. 
Sensors- Sensors are electronic devices that can sense the physical environment and sends the signals to a computer or controller. 
Smart Sensors- Consists of the sensing device, processor, memory, analog to digital converter, signal processing element. 
Actuators- Actuators receives the signals from a controller or central computer and accordingly activities a physical devices, appliances or system. 
Smart actuators- Receives the commands or signals from a network, mobile devices. 
Connecting LED, DHT 11& PIR Motion Sensor with Arduino. 
Steps to work on Arduino.

Traditional Computing - Traditional computing in IoT (Internet of Things) refers to the use of conventional computing systems like local servers, desktops, or embedded systems to collect, process, and store IoT data — without relying on cloud services.
Types of Computing- 
i-Distributed Computing - A collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system. 
ii-Cluster Computing- Homogenous computing nodes working together. 
iii-Grid Computing- Heterogeneous computing nodes distributed over a wide area to perform a very large task. 
iv- Cloud Computing- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure,you can access services like:
Servers
Storage
Databases
Networking
Software
Analytics
AI and more
Types of Cloud Computing:
Public Cloud – Services offered over the internet by third-party providers (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud).
Private Cloud – Used by a single organization, either on-premise or hosted.
Hybrid Cloud – Combination of public and private clouds for flexibility.
Cloud Service Models:
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)	Virtual machines, storage, neModels. Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine
PaaS (Platform as a Service)	Tools for developers to build apps.	Google App Engine, Heroku
SaaS (Software as a Service)	Fully managed apps via browser. Gmail, Microsoft 365, Dropbox

Data cleaning- Removing and fixing incorrect, incomplete and irrelevant data. 
Data processing- Transforming raw data into suitable format for analysis & testing modelling. 
Tasks in preprocessing
1.Handling missing values. 
2.Scaling
3.Normalization

Different types of graphs 
-Line graph 
-Bar graph 
-Pie charts 
-Scatter plots 
-Histogram 
Libraries used for representation of graphs 
matplotlib- Basic and flexible tool to create graphs 
Seaborn - It is advanced lib of matplot. 
Real time data plotting :- libraries used 
random- to simulate random data values. 
time - to create time delay and measure time.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and visualizing data to understand its main characteristics before applying any machine learning or statistical models.
Key purposes of EDA:
Discover patterns in the data
Identify outliers and anomalies
Check assumptions (e.g., distribution of data)
Summarize main features using statistics and visuals
Common EDA Techniques:
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
Data visualization (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps)
Correlation analysis (to understand relationships between variables)
In simple terms, EDA helps you get to know your data before doing deeper analysis or modeling.

Machine learning
Different types of learning in machine learning
1.Supervised learning
2.Unsupervised learning
3.Reinforcement learning
Two phases of machine learning
Training phase. 
Testing phase.
